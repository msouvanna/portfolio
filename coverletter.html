    <p style="color: white;"> To who it may concern, <br><br>
      I am writing to express my interest in the available position at your esteemed company. At your convenience, I'd appreciate the opportunity to
      discuss opportunities and my candidacy with you. You can find my resume attached.
      As a recent graduate from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock with a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Information 
      Technology along with my previous experience as a Mechanical Assembler, I have learned valuable skills and developed a goal-oriented work ethic. 
      <br>
      My experience as a Mechanical Assembler has provided me with a solid foundation in practical 
      problem-solving and attention to detail. This experience has equipped me with the necessary skills to 
      excel in any role and has prepared me for the challenges of a fast-paced work environment. In particular, I would like to highlight three ways my 
      experience as a Mechanical Assembler has prepared me for a new role:
      <br><br>
      1. Attention to detail: As a Mechanical Assembler, I was responsible for ensuring that each component of
       the product was assembled accurately and efficiently as even one small component could break an entire unit. This involved a high 
       level of detail-oriented work which translated into a strong ability to identify and resolve any issues that may arise in a timely and accurate manner.
      <br><br>
      2. Technical proficiency: My experience as a Mechanical Assembler has exposed me to a variety of technical tools and equipment such as 
      a soldering iron. The use of multiple technical tools showcases my willingness to get my hands a bit 'dirty' if the time and place calls for it.
      <br><br>
      3. Adaptability: As a Mechanical Assembler, I was part of various teams that worked on different projects. Though different in thier own way, 
      these teams were responsible for producing different types of products, each with its unique requirements. This experience has enabled me to 
      adapt quickly to changing environments and perform well under pressure when given different tasks to do.
      <br><br>
      In addition to the work I've done as a mechnical assembler, I also gained skills and knowledge for different programming languages and web applications 
      including Java, HTML, C++, CSS, BootStrap, Canva, Figma, and Microsoft Office.
      <br><br>
      Moreover, I possess strong teamwork, communication and collaboration skills. Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have been a part of several 
      team projects and have developed effective communication strategies that have led to successful outcomes. I strongly believe that these skills are essential 
      for any role and would make me an asset to your company. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss with you how I can assist your company. Feel free to contact me 
      anytime at (501) 326-1333. I will be available at your convenience.
      <br><br>
      Thank you for your consideration,
      <br><br>
